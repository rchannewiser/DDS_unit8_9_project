This is the Repository for Case Study 1: Budweiser Presentation

The purpose of the project is to answer the questions asked of me by the CEO of Budweiser, Mr. Carlos Brito, and to provide any further insight beyond these questions. 

Files contained within are:

Beer.csv - a csv input file with the beer data.
Breweries.csv - a csv input file with the brewery data.
Budweiser_Presentation.pptx - a powerpoint file with slides for the overall presentation.
Budweiser Presentation.Rmd - an R Markdown file containing the R code used to develop the insights.
Budweiser-Presentation.html - an html file containing the R code complete with charts and outputs used to develop the insights.
